# Components

Components are independent and reusable bits of code.

* * *

## 📏 Usage

Declare shared components used by pages, layouts and features. They are not dependant on contexts, hooks, selectors or other state handler.

They are fully reusable and use props, events, variants and component api for domain logic integration.

-   Group components by flat folders in `PascalCase`.
-   Export them in a dedicated entry point.
