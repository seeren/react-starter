# Assets

Saving images in src directory is a good solution and it is oftentimes encouraged to use instead of the static file serving.

## 📏 Usage

Store in this folder globals or shared assets, exemple:

-   Global library CSS/SCSS entry point
-   Shared CSS/SCSS helper
-   Globals Fonts

For assets used in a single feature, scope theses assets in the related feature folder.
