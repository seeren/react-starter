# Assets

> Assets use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), adapt as needed.

Saving assets in src directory is a good solution and it is oftentimes encouraged to use instead of the static file serving.

## 📏 Usage

Store in this folder globals assets.

_scss/index.scss_

```scss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

For assets used by components, scope them in the related folder.
